Henry bootstrapped the business to $1M in revenue before its acquisition in 2014.
 
Henry also cofounded the first incubator in Harlem, New York City—Cofound Harlem—which aims to foster economic development North of 96th Street in Manhattan. 

Henry served as Program Director under David S. Rose in the Real Estate technology accelerator, AREA, together with Lauren Rose. The accelerator program invested in companies across the Real Estate landscape from construction, Private Equity pipeline software, zoning analysis, and consumer rental platforms.

Henry cofounded Harlem Capital, an early-stage, diversity-focused Venture Capital firm investing in Women and Minority founders; anchored by TPG and managing $175M AUM across two funds.

Henry is also passionate about Media. Henry hosted the TV show ‘Hustle’ on VICELAND, Executive Produced by Alicia Keys and Marcus Samuelsson; and produced and hosted branded podcasts for brands like The Washington Post, Gimlet Media, WeWork, eBay, and Samsung.
